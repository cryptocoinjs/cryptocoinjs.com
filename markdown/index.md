CryptoCoinJS
============

CryptoCoinJS is a JavaScript project that helps you to interface with many of the crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more. Most of the modules are fully compatible with the browser and Node.js. Naturally, the modules that interface directly with peer nodes won't run in the browser.


Principles
----------

We believe in the Node.js and UNIX philosophy - the idea of building small components that do one thing and do it well. Writing software in this manner allows individuals to use and contribute much more effectively than writing one monolithic library.

We believe that people are more important than code and therefore it's critical to write code that is easy to read, document each module with the API and examples, and that code is the enemy [1](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/) [2](http://blog.codinghorror.com/size-is-the-enemy/).

We believe that writing tests is one of the best ways to communicate expectations between developers. If documentation is a way to commuincate for a consumer of your module, then tests are a way to communicate between developers.

We have our work cut out for us.



Platforms
---------

CryptoCoinJS is focused on Node.js and the browser using [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify). We have made an active decision to NOT support legacy browsers. i.e. if your browser does not support [ECMAScript 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (2009-2010) and it doesn't support [window.crypto.getRandomValues()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.crypto.getRandomValues) some of the modules may not work.

Modules
-------

Note: If a component won't work on the client (browser), then it'll be marked as **server only**.

### Active

#### Crypto Currency

* [bip38](modules/currency/bip38) - Password encrypted private keys
* [btc-p2p](modules/currency/btc-p2p) - Manage a network of Bitcoin peers. **(server only)**
* [coininfo](modules/currency/coininfo) - Fetch currency specific information such as ports and version numbers
* [coinkey](modules/currency/coinkey) - Create private keys, public keys, and addresses. (Inherits from [eckey](modules/currency/eckey.md))
* [coinstring](modules/currency/coinstring) - Create, parse, or validate addresses a wallet import format strings
* [eckey](modules/currency/eckey) - Super class for [coinkey](modules/currency/coinkey) used for private and public elliptic curve keys
* [hdkey](modules/currency/hdkey) - [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)(hierarchical deterministic keys)
* [p2p-manager](modules/currency/p2p-node) - Manage a network of peers in a p2p network. **(server only)**
* [p2p-node](modules/currency/p2p-node) - Low-level library to handle p2p traffic on crypto currency networks. **(server only)**

(the following are poorly documented and need some TLC)

* [btc-address](modules/currency/btc-address) - Address handling library for Bitcoin. Possibly irrelevant by [coinkey](modules/currency/coinkey) or [coinstring](modules/currency/coinstring)
* [btc-opcode](modules/currency/btc-opcode) - Bitcoin opcodes
* [btc-script](modules/currency/btc-script) - Bitcoin Script
* [btc-scriptinterpreter](modules/currency/btc-scriptinterpreter) - btc-scriptinterpreter - Bitcoin Script Interpreter
* [btc-transaction](modules/currency/btc-transaction) - Bitcon Transaction Creation / Parsing

#### Cryptography

* [aes](modules/crypto/aes.md) - Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard
* [crypto-hashing](modules/crypto/crypto-hashing) - Normalize interfaces to crypto hashing routines such as SHA256 / RIPEMD160
* [ecdsa](modules/crypto/ecdsa.md) - Signing & verfication for Elliptic Curve Cryptography
* [ecurve](modules/crypto/ecurve) - Main module for Elliptic Curve Cryptography
* [pbkdf2-sha256](modules/crypto/pbkdf2-sha256) - PBKDF2 using SHA256 HMAC
* [ripemd160](modules/crypto/ripemd160) - RIPEMD160 hash
* [scryptsy](modules/crypto/scrypt) - Scrypt key derivation



#### Misc

* [bigi](modules/misc/bigi) - BigInteger library (port of Tom Wu's library)
* [binstring](modules/misc/binstring) - Convert data types. i.e. convert between `Array`, `Buffer`, `UTF8`, `Hex`, etc
* [bs58](modules/misc/bs58) - BASE58 encoding / decoding
* [qr-encode](modules/misc/qr-encode) - Encode data into QR codes 



### Deprecated

* [ecurve-names](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/ecurve-names) - Moving curves to ecurve
* [sha256](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/sha256) - Outsourced to [crypto-browserify][crypto-browserify] through [crypto-hashing](modules/crypto/crypto-hashing)


### Unknown

The library that bundles everything is located here: [https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/cryptocoin](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/cryptocoin). The NPM module is [cryptocoin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cryptocoin).

Development moves quickly with each individual module and packaging up a release in the larger module is tedious and error prone. So, the state of the large bundle is unknown. 



Use In Production
-----------------

* [Coinbolt](https://www.coinbolt.com) - Simple & Secure Wallet
* [Helloblock](https://helloblock.io) - Block Explorer with Mainnet and Testnet API
* [Bitrated](https://www.bitrated.com) - Arbitration Marketplace

Thanks
------

This library wouldn't be possible without some of the great work of [Stefan Thomas](https://github.com/justmoon), [Tom Wu](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/), authors of [CryptoJS](https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/), and authors of [SJCL](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/graphs/contributors). Also, recent contributions to BitcoinJS by [Kyle Drake](https://github.com/kyledrake), [Daniel Cousens](https://github.com/dcousens), and [Wei Lu](https://github.com/weilu) have helped tremendously. We owe all of the aforementioned a heartfelt thank you for building the foundation for all of this.

Last, but surely not least, we owe [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) a heartfelt thank you for inventing what will surely be one of the greatest inventions of mankind.
